Game:
###ghost is too weak/slow, especially moving upwards 
monkey class
two part wings item that gives triple jump 
increased difficulty as time alive increases
midair collisions with sprites, rock bounces off player if it bumps into it while falling for respositioning?
do something with one health pieces, potentially able to jump off them if jump timed just about when you would land -> upward moving particles to show feature could look cool
###default resolution / settings remembered from last play session
end screen

Bugs:
###anvil particles inaccurate 
teleport futureRect glitch is worse than before -> still not fixed, need to work on it.
###onGround on edge of screen without any piece
